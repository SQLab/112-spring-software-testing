## Introduction

In this lab, you will write tests in `main_test.js`. You can learn how to use [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to tests a web UI.

## Preparation (Important!!!)

1. Sync fork your branch (e.g., `SQLab:311XXXXXX`)
2. `git checkout -b lab4` (**NOT** your student ID !!!)

1. (100%) Goto https://pptr.dev/, type `chipi chipi chapa chapa` into the search box, click on **1st** result in the **Docs** section, and print the title.

For the detailed steps and hints, please check the slide of this lab.

You can run `validate.sh` in your local to test if you satisfy the requirements.

1. you modify other files to achieve requirements.
2. you can't pass all CI on your PR.

## Submission

You need to open a pull request to your branch (e.g. 311XXXXXX, your student number) and contain the code that satisfies the abovementioned requirements.

Moreover, please submit the URL of your PR to E3. Your submission will only be accepted when you present at both places.
