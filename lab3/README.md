# Lab3

## Introduction

In this lab, you will write unit tests for functions implemented in `main.js`. You can learn how to use classes and functions in it by uncommenting the code in it. (But remember don't commit them on GitHub)

## Preparation (Important!!!)

1. Sync fork on GitHub
2. `git checkout -b lab3` (**NOT** your student ID !!!)

## Requirement

1. (40%) Write test cases in `main_test.js` and achieve 100% code coverage.
2. (30%) For each function, parameterize their testcases to test the error-results.
3. (30%) For each function, use at least 3 parameterized testcases to test the non-error-results.

You can run `validate.sh` in your local to test if you satisfy the requirements.

Please note that you must not alter files other than `main_test.js`. You will get 0 points if

1. you modify other files to achieve requirements.
2. you can't pass all CI on your PR.

## Submission

You need to open a pull request to your branch (e.g. 311XXXXXX, your student number) and contain the code that satisfies the abovementioned requirements.

Moreover, please submit the URL of your PR to E3. Your submission will only be accepted when you present at both places.
