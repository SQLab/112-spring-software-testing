## Test Valgrind and ASan

### Environment

 - gcc: 11.4.0
 - vargrind: 3.18.1

### Result
|                      | Valgrind | Asan |
| -------------------- | -------- | ---- |
| Heap out-of-bounds   |   Yes    | Yes  |
| Stack out-of-bounds  |   NO     | Yes  |
| Global out-of-bounds |   NO     | Yes  |
| Use-after-free       |   Yes    | Yes  |
| Use-after-return     |   Yes    | Yes  |

### Heap out-of-bounds
#### Source code
```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
        char *heap = (char *)malloc(3);

        // Heap out-of-bounds read/write
        printf("Heap out-of-bounds read heap[3] = %c", heap[3]);
        heap[3] = 'a';

        return 0;
}

### ASan Report

==48042==The signal is caused by a READ memory access.
==48042==Hint: this fault was caused by a dereference of a high value address (see register values below).  Dissassemble the provided pc to learn which register was used.

## ASan Out-of-bound Write bypass Redzone
### Source code
```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void){

    char *a = (char*)malloc(3);
    char *b = (char*)malloc(3);
    int offset = b - a;

    b[0] = 'b';
    a[offset] = 'a';
    printf("b[0] = %c\n", a[offset]);
    free(a);
    free(b);

    return 0;
}
```
### Why

Since ASan only checks whether the shadow value of the target address is zero to determine whether it is out-of-bound, it won't be detected regardless of where the initial pointer starts from as long as the final target address is legal. Therefore, out-of-bound writes bypassing the redzone will not be detected.
