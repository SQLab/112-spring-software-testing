## Test Valgrind and ASan
### Result
|                      | Valgrind | Asan |
| -------------------- | -------- | ---- |
| Heap out-of-bounds   |    yes   |  yes |
| Stack out-of-bounds  |     no   |  yes |

### Heap out-of-bounds
#### Source code
```
#include <iostream>

int main() {

    int* array = new int[5];

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        array[i] = i;
    }


    std::cout << "access the last element: " << array[4] << std::endl;
    std::cout << "out of bound: " << array[5] << std::endl;  


    delete[] array;

    return 0;
}

```

## ASan Out-of-bound Write bypass Redzone
### Source code
```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a[8];
    int b[8];

    // 初始化數組 a 和 b
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        a[i] = 123;
        b[i] = 456;
    }

    // 計算數組 a 到 b 的偏移
    int diff = &b[0] - &a[0];

    // 非法操作：使用計算出的偏移修改 b[0]
    // 這行為未定義，因為 diff 不一定正確指向 b[0] 的索引
    a[diff] = 789;

    std::cout << "b[0] = " << b[0] << std::endl;
    std::cout << "b[1] = " << b[1] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
### Why
a 和 b 是兩個連續的整數數組。當計算 diff （即 &b[0] - &a[0]）時，實際上是在計算從數組 a 到數組 b 的開始的距離。這種計算可能可以利用pointer算術來跨過數組 a 的界限並訪問數組 b，但這裡沒有直接寫入或讀取redzone的行為。
