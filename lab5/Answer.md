### Heap out-of-bounds
#### Source code
```

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main(){

    int *p = (int *)malloc(8*sizeof(int));

    // writing out of bounds
    p[8] = 88888888;

    //reading out of bounds
    printf("I'm so good at reading heap %d\n", p[8]);
    free(p);
    
    return 0;

}

## ASan Out-of-bound Write bypass Redzone
### Source code
```
int main(){

    int a[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4,};   
    int b[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4,};   

    printf("I'm so good at reading stack %d\n", a[8]);
    // if we do nothing to b, it will be optimized out.
    printf("I'm so good at reading stack %d\n", b[9]);
    return 0;

}
```
### Why
When declaring two arrays, their memories will be allocated consecutively. ASAN will put red zones before, between, and after them. Suppose we access the first array out of bounds to a specific degree. In that case, it is possible for us to access the data in the second without touching the red zone between the two arrays, avoiding being detected by ASAN.
