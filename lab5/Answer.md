## Test Valgrind and ASan
### Result
|                      | Valgrind | Asan |
| -------------------- | -------- | ---- |
| Heap out-of-bounds   | YES      | YES  |

### Heap out-of-bounds
#### Source code
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *ptr = malloc(5 * sizeof(int));

    // Writing out of bounds
    ptr[5] = 6;

    // Reading out of bounds
    int val = ptr[5];

    free(ptr);

    return 0;
}
```

## ASan Out-of-bound Write bypass Redzone
### Source code
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int b[] = {5, 6, 7, 8};

    a[8] = 56;
    printf("a[8] = %d\n", a[8]);
    
    return 0;
}
```
### Why

ASan不能找出Out-of-bound Write，因為讀寫的Address剛好越過了redzone，而輸出結果為：
```
gcc -fsanitize=address -Og -g -o test_asan source.c
./test_asan
a[8] = 56
```
